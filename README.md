# Portable Bevameter Design for Geotechnical Characterization on Planetary Surfaces
This github repository consists of all of the documented software used for the operation of the portable bevameter, as well as the data analysis methods from the results.  Include additionally are the data trials used in the paper, as well as the CAD model of the bevameter assembly.
## Data
The data collected has been formatted as text (.txt) files for easy access during data analysis.
- LHS-1 Trials.zip - 30 trials for Lunar Highlands Simulant (from Exolith Labs) sample
- LSMK Trials.zip - 30 trials for Lower Slope Mauna Kea sample
- USMK Trials - 30 trials for Upper Slope Mauna Kea sample
- Pond Silt Trials - 30 trials for Pond Silt sample 
## Software
The software used for this research project includes Arduino IDE for the operation of the bevameter, and a python notebook for the data analysis from the bevameter results.
- blankSD5.2 folder - Contains Arduino IDE program for bevameter operation
- Pressure-Sinkage_Data_Analysis.ipynb - Data analysis python notebook of bevameter results.
## CAD
The primary software used to design the portable bevameter was Onshape, with all of the components in the assembly being exported as a STEP file (fasteners not included).
- Bevameter CAD Assembly.step - Entire bevameter system modeled in CAD software.
